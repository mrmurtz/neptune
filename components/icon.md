# Icon

Icons are used to visually represent features, actions and activities.

## Usage

Use icons to:

- help differentiate items in a list
- indicate interactive areas
- highlight state of a component

## Size

We use 2 sizes of icons, small and large. They may not be manually resized, but are allowed to be scaled based on accessibility preferences of the platform set by the user.

## Color

Icons can take different colors depending on their intended effect:

### Accent

- Indicate interactive areas
- Reinforce that the whole component is tappable/clickable (e.g. media element on a [Cell](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune/blob/master/components/cell.md))
- Highlight the state of a component (e.g. active item in a tab bar)

### Primary

- Differentiate items in lists based on user data (e.g. feed, activity list)
- Differentiate items in static lists (e.g. Instruction List)
